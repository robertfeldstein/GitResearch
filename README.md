This repository covers the lightning research performed with Professor Joe Guinness at Cornell University.


In these notebooks we cover how to extract data from NOAA's GOES-R satellites, including its Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) product. We investigate some of the data surrounding lightning strikes, and hope to build a machine learning model which can predict lightning strikes ahead of time.
